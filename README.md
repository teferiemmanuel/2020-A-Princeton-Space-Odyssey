# 2020: A Princeton Space Odyssey

The year is 2020, and you are stranded in outer space, far far away from home. To get home you must travel through a series of wormholes. But hereâ€™s the catch, you need fuel to travel through these wormholes.

Pilot a spaceship flying through outer space as you attempt to warp home by collecting fuel charges. The primary objective will be achieved by the player collecting fuel charges as they spawn. To complete a level, the player must gather enough fuel charges within a time limit.

## Installation

Before you begin, you will need to install [NodeJS and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Then, open a terminal instance and set your working directory to the root of the project and run `npm install`.

## Launching a Local Webserver

You can spin up a local development webserver using `npm start`. This command will bundle the project code and start a development server at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). Visit this in your web browser; every time you make changes to the code, _the page will automatically refresh._

## Building the Project for the Web

Once you are happy with your project, try building a production bundle using `npm run build`. This will place an optimized and minified executable version of your project in the `./build/` directory. Test out this production build by setting `./build/` as your working directory and starting out a python server.

Once you have a working production build and are ready for the site to go live, you can deploy your project straight to GitHub Pages via `npm run deploy`. Note that this requires that (1) your project is part of a repository, and (2) you have correctly set up your project's `package.json` file.
